# @jayphelps/jay-scripts

A collection of common scripts for my personal projects. Not intended to be used by others as I'll likely make frequent breaking changes without warning. Open source in case it's useful as a reference, and also why not.

This project is self-hosted; it was bootstraped and is built using an older version of itself.

## Create

```bash
npx @jayphelps/react-scripts create my-project-name
cd my-project-name
```

## Start
