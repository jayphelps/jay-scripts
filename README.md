# @jayphelps/jay-scripts

A collection of common scripts for my personal projects. Not intended to be used by others, but you're free to if you wish. This project is self-hosted; it was bootstraped and is built using an older version of itself.

## Create

```bash
npx @jayphelps/react-scripts create my-project-name
cd my-project-name
```

## Start

```bash
yarn start
```

## Build
